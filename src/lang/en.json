    "info": [
      "I am Jacky Wu, a graduate of the Department of Information Management at National University of Kaohsiung in 2019. During my high school years, I studied abroad in the United States for one year. In college, I transferred from I-Shou University to National University of Kaohsiung, and my diverse academic experiences have cultivated my ability to think independently and reflect on myself.",
      "During my college years, I was enthusiastic about practical courses and actively participated in practical projects. In my senior year, I had the opportunity to be responsible for developing the international student recruitment system for the university, accumulating full-stack development experience and developing an interest in front-end development.",
      "After graduation, I continued to devote myself to the field of front-end development and have accumulated three years of work experience. I specialize in the VueJs framework, responsible for system page design, writing front-end specification documents, user interaction design, and back-end API integration. At the same time, I actively learn new technologies, proficient in TypeScript, Vue3, Eslint, and other tools, and can use these technologies to optimize the development process and improve development efficiency.",
      "In the future, I hope to become an excellent engineer and gradually achieve the following goals:",
      "1-5 years: Become an engineer who can independently solve problems and learn quickly.",
      "5-8 years: Become a technical supervisor with leadership skills who can lead a team to complete projects.",
      "After 8 years: Become a technology expert who introduces new technologies and improves team performance."
